come down softly to my soul
eyes low chin heavy shoegazer
we can speed in my 2 seater
I'm not the jesus of suburbia
the lunatic is on the grass
seeing you got ritualistic
kissing on the werewolf
champagne supernova in the sky
bitch don't kill my vibe
wish we've grown up on the same advice
real niggas do not deserve pussy
we don't decide anything in god's time
